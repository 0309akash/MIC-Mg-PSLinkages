## About this Repository

This repository will serve as a central resource for the course content in the Materials
Informatics Laboratory session for the FLAMEL program at the Georgia Institute of Technology
in the Fall term.

## About this Branch

The ``gh-pages`` branch of a Github repository provides a web hosting service for its underlying content.
This course's lab content will be served through Github because it provides a very close
interconnection between codes, data, publication, and teaching tools.

This static, blog-aware website is driven by [Jekyll](www.jekyllrb.com).  I have augmented
the boilerplate Jekyll site a little with some nice [octicons](octicons.github.com),
comments from [Disqus](disqus.com), and presentation embeddings through [Slideshare](slideshare.net).

Please feel free to comment before, during, and after the course.
