title: Final Post- Executive summary of Project
---
### Initial project - Process-Structure linkages using Experimental dataset

+ Initially our project was to develop process-structure linkages for Channelâ€“die Compressed AM30 Magnesium Alloy.
Details of this project can be found at [_Project Description post_](http://penpatel.github.io/MIC-Mg-PSLinkages/2014/09/10/Project-Description.html)
+ Details of dataset and project progress reports can be found at [_Progress Reporting post_](http://penpatel.github.io/MIC-Mg-PSLinkages/2014/09/16/Progress-Reporting.html)
+ We worked on experimental EBSD dataset obtained from Mississipi state university and developed protocols to compute
2-point statistics from experimental EBSD data using binning of fundamental zone. Details of protocol can be found
at [_this post_](http://www.slideshare.net/fullscreen/0309akash/process-structure-linkages-for-channeldie-compressed-mg-alloy-22102014/1)

### Reasons for discarding initial project

+ Not enough data points - only 40 microstructures
+ Quality of data not good
+ Problem of charging in some microstructures
+ Image quality and confidence index poor

### Final Project - Structure-Property linkages using Synthetic dataset

+ New protocols were developed to establish structure-property linkages for polycrystalline material using continous basis function
  Generalized Spherical Harmonics (GSH), which provides compact representation for lattice orientations.
+ Details of dataset, GSH and initial plots of statistics using GSH can be found at post [_2 point statistics using GSH basis function_](http://penpatel.github.io/MIC-Mg-PSLinkages/2014/11/11/2pt-Statistics-using-GSH.html)
+ Preliminary results of PCA and linkages were discussed on post [_PCA and Structure-Property linkages_](http://penpatel.github.io/MIC-Mg-PSLinkages/2014/12/01/PCA-Structure-Property-Linkages.html)
 . These preliminary results were wrong due to bug in our code.
+ Final presentation describing protocols, results and preliminary linkages can be seen below. This presentation contains
  our final results which are correct. Linkages needs further improvement.

### Highlights of project

+ Project progress was posted online and discussed biweekly in class using github posts. All the posts created on page
of this project can be seen using our [_Project Page_](http://penpatel.github.io/MIC-Mg-PSLinkages/index.html)
+ Protocols were developed to compute structure-property linkages for polycrystalline material using GSH basis function 
to represent crystal orientation
+ Protocols were developed for computing 2-point statistics using binning for experimental EBSD dataset
+ Preliminary structure-property linkages were developed for elastic response of polycrystalline materials
+ This project will be extended to develop linkages for plastic response of polycrystalline materials
+ As part of class assignment overview posts for material informatics tools/databases were created. Our team did 
overview of [_NIST Databases_](http://penpatel.github.io/MIC-Mg-PSLinkages/2014/11/25/NIST-databases-overview.html) and [_CALPHAD_](http://penpatel.github.io/MIC-Mg-PSLinkages/2014/11/22/Calphad-overview.html)
, details of which can be found at respective posts.
