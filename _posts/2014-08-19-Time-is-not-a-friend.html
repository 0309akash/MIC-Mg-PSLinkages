## Time is not on your side

Lags in communication and information access have a dramatic impact on both yourself and your collaborators.  Developing products and deploying scientific research can be drastically increased by simply streamlining you communications with your collaborators.  Streamlining communication creates less waste on your end and eases your collaborators energy expended in responding or collaborating with you.

Rapid product and research deployment requires moving information and communications along [ansynchroneously].  At the same time it behooves researchers to centralized all their research *end-products* by optimizing their innovation stack.  Centralizing Software, Data, Publications, and Teaching tools will minimize many non-technical workflow redundancies.

Research science must begin to embrace better means of [asynchroneous communication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_communication) that is inspired by the complex relationship between the research *end-products*.  A collaborative research stack will efficiently manage discussions and comments that provide critical metadata to software, data, publications, and teaching tools.

### Examples of Improved Efficiencies

* Sharing public dropbox links instead of email attachments.
* Accessing presentations through the Web, not email.
* Commenting code itself and not an email string discussing a zip file containing code.

## Workflow Redundancies and Pipelines

Delivery information to your collaborators promptly is critical to a fluid collaboration.  Often times trivial tasks seem heruclean because the wrong software is being used.  Improving the speed of information access reduces overall non-technical work in a collaboration because it directly reduces the work that each agent in the collaboration needs to expend.

In [So you want to be a computational biologist?](www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v31/n11/full/nbt.2740.html) they suggest **Pipelineitis is a nasty disease**.  Futher they offer a warning to researchers that states:

> Warning: don't pipeline too early. Get a method working before you turn it into a pipeline. And even then, does it need to be a pipeline? Have you saved time? Is your pipeline really of use to others? If those steps are only ever going to be run by you, then a simple script will suffice and any attempts at pipelining will simply waste time. Similarly, if those steps will only ever be run once, just run them once, document the fact you did so and move on.
