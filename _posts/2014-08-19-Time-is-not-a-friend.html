## Interfacing Scientific Research Products

Materials research science has several concurrent goals varying degrees of importance to the agents in the collaboration.  In research science, we produce:

### Software

Software are the codes and raw language that transform information into knowledge.
Software includes OEM software, open source software, enterprise software, homegrown software,
etc.  A well documented software process is critical to
[reproducible research](http://reproducibleresearch.net/).  Sometimes the research
process may yield reusable codes for internal group use or a community at large.

### Data

Data is the general currency of materials research.  Materials scientist work directly on
or abstract the physical world virtually to understand why the materials that we use
in our life behave the way that they do.  Materials data can come from everywhere and in everyway possible.
Materials Data may be the main product of a thrust or as simple as an input into data
science problems.

### Publication

Peer reviewed publications are typically a culmination of

#### Disparities in Publication Models

### Teaching Tools

## A Balancing Act

![Important By-products of Research Science](https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2911/14305197074_8ca6ee1b7c.jpg)
The goals of agents in a research collaboration are not created equal.  There are many consequences
to research and each contributer has a role and talent.  Elements of the research science
spectrum have a value external to the collaboration itself.  The science ultimate contributes to the public good.
Managing Big Data and modern research science could stand to inject a more democratic process
into the dissemination of its researchers products.

> As a researcher, we are rarely aware of the entire scope of our works applicability.

## Time is not on your side

Lags in communication and information access have a dramatic impact on both yourself and your collaborators.  Developing products and deploying scientific research can be drastically increased by simply streamlining you communications with your collaborators.  Streamlining communication creates less waste on your end and eases your collaborators energy expended in responding or collaborating with you.

Rapid product and research deployment requires moving information and communications along
[asynchroneously](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_communication).  At the
 same time it behooves researchers to centralize their research *end-products*
 by optimizing their innovation stack.  Centralizing Software, Data, Publications,
 and Teaching tools will minimize many non-technical workflow redundancies.

Research science must begin to embrace better means of
[asynchroneous communication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_communication)
that is inspired by the complex relationship between the research *end-products*.
A collaborative research stack will efficiently manage discussions and comments
that provide critical metadata to software, data, publications, and teaching tools.

How can we minimize the work in transferring information?

## Workflow Redundancies and Pipelines

Delivery information to your collaborators promptly is critical to a fluid collaboration.  Often times trivial tasks seem heruclean because the wrong software is being used.  Improving the speed of information access reduces overall non-technical work in a collaboration because it directly reduces the work that each agent in the collaboration needs to expend.

In [So you want to be a computational biologist?](www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v31/n11/full/nbt.2740.html) the authors suggest **Pipelineitis is a nasty disease**.  Futher they offer a warning to researchers that states:

> Warning: don't pipeline too early. Get a method working before you turn it into a pipeline. And even then, does it need to be a pipeline? Have you saved time? Is your pipeline really of use to others? If those steps are only ever going to be run by you, then a simple script will suffice and any attempts at pipelining will simply waste time. Similarly, if those steps will only ever be run once, just run them once, document the fact you did so and move on.

## Critical Role of Speed to Publication in Collaboration

> **Why are startups failing so badly everywhere we look?**
The first problem is the allure of a good plan, a solid strategy, and thorough
market research. In earlier eras, these things were indicators of likely success.
The overwhelming temptation is to apply them to startups too, but this doesnâ€™t work,
because startups operate with too much uncertainty. Startups do not yet know who
their customer is or what their product should be. As the world becomes more uncertain,
it gets harder and harder to predict the future. The old management methods are not up to the
task. Planning and forecasting are only accurate when based on a long, stable operating history
and a relatively static environment. Startups have neither.
*Excerpt from the Lean Start Up by Eric Ries*

Science is a Startup; Science progresses under extreme uncertainty; Science is innovation.
Successful innovation requires ideas to be agile and adaptable.  Modern web publishing
can strongly impact innovation in research science by provided a more rapid means to sharing information
than peer review publication with embedded comments.

### Sometimes Research Falls of the Rails

More often than not researchers must wrestle with their misconceptions in the direction of their
research rather than sip champagne while admirely you good work.  Research failures or
poor hypotheses can be circumvented with a willingness and openness to publish using modern web tools.
A blog aware approach to research science if you will..

Peer review can be organic using web publishing by asking colleagues and the community to assess
intermediate progress.  Injecting colleagues opinions into the research process could
potentially reduce unneeded effort and other waste.
