## Objectives of Materials Informatics Lab

The first class will focus on some basic ideas to streamline your research with your
collaborators.  This discussion will focus on the
diversity of scientific research and champion each researchers positive aspects.  Considering
and streamlining your workflows beyond their technical merit affords time to conduct research
independent of conventional drudgeries you must muddle through.

> What are some annoying aspects of collaboration?

Information is expected to relevent outside of your immediate collaboration network
requiring that transparency and open discussion reduce the barrier to mass publication
by introducing community opinions along the continuum of research.

In this lab, we will focus on how our research appears to our collaborators,
colleagues, and community.  When performing research it is critical to ask yourself

> What does my research look like and how accessible is it?

### *Note*

Each course post and project will enable some form of commenting.  Comments will be
served by either Github or Disqus.  Personal emails will be accepted, but questions
pertaining to research, homework, and course content will be semi-open and available through public links.


## Deliverables for Today

For those who have completed these tasks before, I would like to ask you to assist
the other students as they go through the process.  Through having the students teach
each other I hope to reinforce important pieces in collaboration that require you to
educate others.

### Deliverables Task List
