## Problem Statement

* Generate spectral crystal plasticity database for hexagonal materials
  * Modify/locate crystal plasticity codes for different input parameters
    * Different slip-family
    * Twinning
    * Deformation mode, $$ \theta $$
    * c/a ratio
    
 * Validate the crystal plasticity codes with existing results in literature or from our group
 
 * Generate and validate the database against FEM simulations
 
 * Integrate with FEM

## Questions

* How significant is c/a ratio is on different parameters
*
