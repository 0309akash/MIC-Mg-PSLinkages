## Problem Statement

* Generate spectral crystal plasticity database for hexagonal materials
  * Locate and modify crystal plasticity codes for different input parameters
    * Selected slip and twin families
    * c/a ratio ??
    
 * Validate the crystal plasticity codes with existing results in literature or from our group
 
 * Generate and validate the database against FEM simulations
 
 * Integrate with FEM

## Questions

* Building Crystal Plasticity for Hexagonal Systems
  * What are the minimum number of parameters requried to capture the deformation of the generic hexagonal lattice?
  * How does the c/a ratio relate to the slip acitivity?
  * In which alloys does twinning play an important role?
