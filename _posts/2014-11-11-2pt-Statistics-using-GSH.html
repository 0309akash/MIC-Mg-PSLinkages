title: 2 point statistics using GSH basis function
---

### Reason for discarding binning 
+ Binning of Fundamental Zone leads to large number of discrete local states for orientations
+ Indicator basis function is not compact for representing orientations
+ Continuous basis function is needed for compact representation of orientations

### Reason for discarding old experimental dataset
+ Not enough data points - only 40 microstructures
+ Quality of data not good
+ Problem of charging in some microstructures
+ Image quality and confidence index poor

### Details of New dataset for developing Structure-Property Linkages
+ Details of structure dataset obtained from Yuksel (GT) can be found in [this paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359645414006235)
+ Structure dataset for cubic polycrystal is chosen (Cu) 
+ 3-D Microstructure is of size 21x21x21 with cyrstal orientation associated with each voxel
+ Total 3600 microstructures, 1200 each of random, delta and equiaxed
+ FEM elastic deformation simulations were done on 3600 microstructures to simulate uniaxial strain with periodic boundary conditions 
+ Property data (Elastic stiffness) will be calculated from simulation results

### Selecting the continuous basis function
+ Generalized Spherical Harmonics (GSH) [1-3] to represent orientation distribution function over the Fundamental zone
+ GSH provides compact representaion of orientations

### Building microstructure function using GSH basis for computing 2-point statistics

The probability of finding an orientation g and g’ at the tail and the head of a vector, t thrown randomly into a polycrystalline, single phase microstructure is the given by
f_t (g,g^' )=1/S ∑_(s=0)^(S-1)▒〖〖(m〗_s (g) )^* m_(s+t) (g^' ) 〗
where m_s (g) reflects the probability density of finding an orientation g in the spatial cell s. The microstructure function m_s (g) can be represented using a orthogonal series expansion of generalized spherical harmonics (GSH) function
m_s (g)=∑_(k=0)^(S-1)▒∑_L▒〖a_k^L T^L (g)e^(2πiks/S) 〗
Then, then the probability density can be expressed as
f_t (g,g')=∑_L▒∑_(L^')▒〖∑_(k^')▒(a_(k^')^L T^L (g)) ^* a_(k^')^(L^' ) T^(L^' ) (g^')e^((2πik^' t)/S) 〗
