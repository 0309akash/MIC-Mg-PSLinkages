title: 2 point statistics using GSH basis function

---

## Reason for discarding binning 

    + Binning of Fundamental Zone leads to large number of discrete local states for orientations
    + Indicator basis function is not compact for representing orientations
    + Continuous basis function is needed for compact representation of orientations

## Reason for discarding old experimental dataset

    + Not enough data points - only 40 microstructures
    + Quality of data not good
    + Problem of charging in some microstructures
    + Image quality and confidence index poor

## Details of New dataset for developing Structure-Property Linkages

    + Details of structure dataset obtained from Yuksel (GT) can be found in [this paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359645414006235)
    + Structure dataset for cubic polycrystal is chosen (Cu) 
    + 3-D Microstructure is of size 21x21x21 with cyrstal orientation associated with each voxel
    + Total 3600 microstructures, 1200 each of random, delta and equiaxed
    + FEM elastic deformation simulations were done on 3600 microstructures to simulate uniaxial strain with periodic boundary conditions 
    + Property data (Elastic stiffness) will be calculated from simulation results

## Selecting the continuous basis function

    + Generalized Spherical Harmonics (GSH) [1-4] to represent orientation distribution function over the Fundamental zone
    + GSH provides compact representaion of orientations

## Building microstructure function using GSH basis for computing 2-point statistics
