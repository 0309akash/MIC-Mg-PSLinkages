title: 2 point statistics using GSH basis function
---

### Reason for discarding binning 
+ Binning of Fundamental Zone leads to large number of discrete local states for orientations
+ Indicator basis function is not compact for representing orientations
+ Continuous basis function is needed for compact representation of orientations

### Reason for discarding old experimental dataset
+ Not enough data points - only 40 microstructures
+ Quality of data not good
        + problem of charging in some microstructures
        +image quality poor
