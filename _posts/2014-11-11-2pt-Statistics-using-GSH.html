title: 2 point statistics using GSH basis function

---

## Reason for discarding old experimental dataset

+ Not enough data points - only 40 microstructures
+ Quality of data not good
+ Problem of charging in some microstructures
+ Image quality and confidence index poor

## Details of New Synthetic dataset for developing Structure-Property Linkages

+ Details of structure dataset obtained from Yuksel (GT) can be found in [this paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359645414006235)
+ Structure dataset for cubic polycrystal is chosen (Cu) 
+ 3-D Microstructure is of size 21x21x21 with cyrstal orientation associated with each voxel
+ 222 orientations on surface of Fundamental zone were chosen
+ Total 3600 microstructures, 1200 each of random, delta and equiaxed
+ FEM elastic deformation simulations were done on 3600 microstructures to simulate uniaxial strain with periodic boundary conditions 
+ Property data (Elastic stiffness) will be calculated from simulation results

## Reason for discarding binning 

+ Binning of Fundamental Zone leads to large number of discrete local states for orientations
+ Indicator basis function is not compact for representing orientations
+ Continuous basis function is needed for compact representation of orientations

2-point statistics from EBSD data using binning

## Building microstructure function using GSH basis (continuous basis function) for computing 2-point statistics

+ Generalized Spherical Harmonics (GSH) [1-4] to represent orientation distribution function over the Fundamental zone
+ GSH provides compact representaion of orientations
