title: PCA and Structure-Property linkages

---

## Objective and Motivation

+ Most advanced structural materials exhibit polycrystalline microstructures
+ The spatial distribution of the crystal lattice orientations at the microscale plays an important role in controlling
  their effective properties.
+ Communicating the effective properties of polycrystal to the higher length scales â€“ homogenized properties
+ Structure-Property linkages are helpful in providing guidance for process design
